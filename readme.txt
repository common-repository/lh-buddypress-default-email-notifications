== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it allows to control the email preference for already existing members? =

No, it does not.

= How does this plugin behave when network activated? =

When network activated the admin is moved under network admin and is stored as a site_option, these settings will then be in effect across all sites on the multisite.

= What if something does not work?  =

LH Buddypress Default Email Notifications, and all [https://lhero.org](LocalHero) plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones). 

If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfifteen, twentysixteen etc.

If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-buddypress-default-email-notifications/](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-buddypress-default-email-notifications/) . I look there regularly and resolve most queries.
